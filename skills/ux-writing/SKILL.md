# UX Writing

Write clear, helpful copy that guides users through your interface.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Use simple, familiar words
- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Say what you mean directly

### 2. Be Concise
- Cut unnecessary words
- One idea per sentence
- Front-load important information

### 3. Be Helpful
- Tell users what to do, not just what happened
- Provide next steps
- Reduce anxiety and uncertainty

## Button Labels

### Do
- Use action verbs: "Save," "Send," "Create"
- Be specific: "Add to Cart" not "Submit"
- Match user intent: "Sign up free"

### Don't
- Generic: "OK," "Submit," "Continue"
- Vague: "Click here," "Go"
- Negative framing: "Don't cancel"

### Examples
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Submit | Send Message |
| OK | Got it |
| Continue | Next: Payment |
| Cancel | Keep Editing |
| Yes/No | Delete / Keep |

## Error Messages

### Formula
What happened + Why + How to fix it

### Examples
❌ "Error 404"
✅ "Page not found. Try searching or go back to the homepage."

❌ "Invalid input"
✅ "Please enter a valid email address (e.g., name@example.com)"

❌ "Something went wrong"
✅ "We couldn't save your changes. Check your connection and try again."

### Guidelines
- Be specific about the problem
- Avoid blame ("You entered...")
- Suggest a solution
- Use plain language, not error codes

## Empty States

### What to Include
1. What this space is for
2. Why it's empty
3. How to fill it

### Examples

**No search results**
"No results for 'xyz'. Try different keywords or check your spelling."

**Empty inbox**
"No messages yet. When someone contacts you, you'll see it here."

**First-time user**
"Your projects will appear here. Create your first project to get started."

## Loading & Progress

### Short waits (< 2 seconds)
Just show a spinner, no text needed

### Medium waits (2-10 seconds)
"Loading your dashboard..."
"Saving changes..."

### Long waits (> 10 seconds)
"Processing your video. This usually takes 1-2 minutes."
Show progress percentage when possible

## Success Messages

### Be Specific
❌ "Success!"
✅ "Your profile has been updated."

### Confirm the Action
"Message sent to sarah@example.com"
"Order #12345 confirmed. Shipping in 2-3 days."

### Suggest Next Steps
"Password changed. You can now sign in with your new password."

## Tooltips & Hints

### When to Use
- Explain unfamiliar UI elements
- Provide context for actions
- Show keyboard shortcuts

### Keep Them Short
- Under 150 characters
- One concept per tooltip
- No critical information (tooltips are hidden by default)

## Onboarding Copy

### Welcome Messages
- Acknowledge the milestone
- Set expectations
- Point to first action

**Example:**
"Welcome to Acme! Let's set up your workspace in 3 quick steps."

### Progressive Disclosure
- Don't explain everything at once
- Introduce features when relevant
- Use inline hints over tutorials

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Voice (Consistent)
- Friendly but professional
- Clear and direct
- Helpful and supportive

### Tone (Varies by Context)
| Situation | Tone |
|-----------|------|
| Success | Celebratory, warm |
| Error | Calm, helpful |
| Warning | Serious, clear |
| Onboarding | Encouraging, patient |
| Settings | Neutral, informative |
