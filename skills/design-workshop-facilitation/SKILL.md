# Design Workshop Facilitation

Run productive design workshops that bring teams together to solve problems, generate ideas, and align on solutions. Based on best practices from [Intercom's workshop guide](https://www.intercom.com/blog/running-design-workshops/).

## Workshop Types

### Problem Definition Workshops
Unpack complex problems, identify root causes, and align on problem statements.

### Ideation Workshops
Generate diverse solutions through structured brainstorming and sketching exercises.

### Customer Journey Mapping
Map user experiences across touchpoints to identify pain points and opportunities.

### Design Sprints
Compressed multi-day workshops to go from problem to tested prototype.

### Alignment Workshops
Get stakeholders aligned on vision, goals, and product principles.

## Planning Your Workshop

### 1. Start with an Overview

Get the bare-bones, high-level plan in place by answering:

**What is the goal?**
Write 2-3 sentences describing why you're holding this session. Example goals:
- Come together as a team to discuss our vision for the product
- Brainstorm and design "north-star" concepts for our offering
- Draft key principles we should consider in approaching new projects
- Map the customer journey to identify pain points

**Who needs to come?**
- Keep groups small (5-8 people) for active participation
- Include diverse perspectives, especially for ideation sessions
- For problem workshops: include people who understand the problem deeply
- For journey mapping: include customer-facing roles (support, sales)

**What are the tangible outcomes?**
List concrete deliverables:
- At least one concept/screen from each participant at high fidelity
- A list of generated ideas and session summary
- Customer journey map with pain points identified
- Draft product principles document
- Prioritized problem statements with root cause analysis

**When and where?**
- Estimate duration: 1-2 hours for simple sessions, 4-5 hours for deep dives
- Date: Consider multi-day workshops for complex problems
- Location: In-person or remote
  - **In-person**: Larger room with tall central table, high stools, plenty of wall space and whiteboards
  - **Remote**: Video conferencing (Zoom, Google Meet) + virtual whiteboard (Miro, FigJam, Whimsical)
  - **Hybrid**: Use virtual whiteboard as the canvas for all participants

### 2. Work Backwards to Make a Plan

Think about what activities you need to achieve your goals, then chunk them into sections:

1. **Introduction** (5-10 min)
   - Welcome and overview
   - Review agenda and goals
   - Warm-up exercise

2. **Context Setting** (10-15 min)
   - Share problem statement
   - Review research/insights
   - Set constraints and boundaries

3. **Main Activities** (varies by workshop type - see below)

4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min)
   - Group ideas by theme
   - Identify patterns
   - Prioritize concepts

5. **Next Steps** (5-10 min)
   - Assign action items
   - Schedule follow-ups
   - Thank participants

**Plan time buffers**: Add 20-30% buffer time to your estimates. Activities always take longer than expected.

### 3. Detail Activities for Each Workshop Type

#### Problem Definition Workshop Activities

**Activity 1: Problem Statement Writing (15 min)**
- Each person writes their understanding of the problem on sticky notes
- Share and cluster similar problem statements
- Discuss differences to uncover assumptions
- Refine into a single problem statement

**Activity 2: Root Cause Analysis (20 min)**
- Use "5 Whys" technique: Ask "why" 5 times to get to root cause
- Or use fishbone diagram to map contributing factors
- Identify the core problem vs. symptoms

**Activity 3: Problem Prioritization (15 min)**
- Use 2x2 matrix: Impact vs. Effort, or Urgency vs. Importance
- Dot vote on which problems to tackle first
- Document why certain problems were prioritized

**Deliverables:**
- Prioritized problem statements
- Root cause analysis diagram
- Problem prioritization matrix

#### Ideation Workshop Activities

**Activity 1: Warm-up with Crazy 8s (10 min)**
- Fold a sheet of paper into 8 sections
- Draw one idea in each section (8 ideas in 8 minutes)
- Focus on quantity, not quality
- Gets people comfortable with sketching

**Activity 2: Silent Brainstorming (10 min)**
- Everyone writes ideas individually on sticky notes
- One idea per sticky note
- No discussion yet - just get ideas out
- Encourage "bad" ideas, unfeasible ones, and wild concepts

**Activity 3: Idea Sharing and Building (20 min)**
- Each person shares their ideas (1-2 minutes each)
- Others build on ideas: "What if we combined this with that?"
- Group similar ideas together
- Encourage building, not critiquing

**Activity 4: Concept Sketching (15-20 min)**
- Pick top 3-5 ideas to explore deeper
- Each person sketches 1-2 concepts
- Focus on how it works, not visual polish
- Can be rough sketches, wireframes, or storyboards

### 4. Facilitation Best Practices

**Before the Workshop**

- **Delegate preparation**: Ask teammates to prepare sections (e.g., PM presents problem, researcher shares insights)
- **Make slides or virtual whiteboard**: Create sections for each activity, including breaks
- **Send prep materials**: Share context, research, or reading materials in advance
- **Test technology**: For remote, ensure everyone can access tools
- **Prep physical space**: For in-person, have sticky notes, markers, wall space ready

**During the Workshop**

**Time Management:**
- Keep an eye on the clock subtly (no countdown timers - too pressured)
- Announce time limits for each activity
- Build in buffer time (20-30% extra)
- Be flexible - extend if a discussion is valuable

**Encourage Participation:**
- Start with icebreaker/warm-up game
- Use "think, pair, share" technique for quiet participants
- Go around the room to give everyone a chance
- Limit dominant voices by time-boxing shares
- Use silent brainstorming first, then discuss

**Stay On Track:**
- Set ground rules upfront (device usage, speaking time)
- Park off-topic questions on a "parking lot" whiteboard
- Address parking lot items at the end or after
- Summarize key points after each section
- Take regular breaks (every 60-90 minutes)

**Documentation:**
- Assign a note-taker beforehand
- Take photos of whiteboards/sketches (in-person or virtual)
- Capture all ideas, not just the "good" ones
- Note decisions and action items clearly
- Document who owns each follow-up item

**After the Workshop**

- **Send recap within 24 hours**: Summarize what you did, key insights, and next steps
- **Include artifacts**: Photos of whiteboards, sketches, journey maps
- **Assign action items**: Who does what by when
- **Schedule follow-ups**: Plan next session or check-in
- **Ask for feedback**: Learn what worked and what didn't

### 5. Remote Workshop Tips

**Tools You'll Need:**
- Video conferencing: Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams
- Virtual whiteboard: Miro, FigJam, Whimsical, Mural
- Documenting: Google Docs, Notion for shared notes

**Best Practices:**
- Everyone should be remote (or everyone in-person) - avoid mixed modes
- Use virtual whiteboard as the main canvas for all participants
- Have everyone on video for engagement
- Use breakout rooms for small group activities
- Share screens frequently for context
- Use reaction emojis for quick voting/feedback
- Record sessions for absent participants (with permission)

**Virtual Whiteboard Setup:**
- Create sections/frames for each activity
- Include instructions in each section
- Pre-populate templates (journey map, 2x2 matrix, etc.)
- Use sticky notes feature for individual ideas
- Enable timer feature for time-boxing
- Save templates for reuse

### 6. Common Workshop Challenges

**Problem: Someone dominates the conversation**
- Solution: Use silent brainstorming first, then time-boxed shares
- Solution: Go around the room in order
- Solution: Redirect: "Let's hear from [other person] next"

**Problem: Group goes off-topic**
- Solution: Park it on a whiteboard, come back later
- Solution: Gently redirect: "That's interesting, let's note it and return to our current focus"
- Solution: Schedule a follow-up discussion if needed

**Problem: People aren't participating**
- Solution: Start with warm-up exercise (e.g., Two Truths and a Lie)
- Solution: Use "think, pair, share" - individual first, then pairs, then group
- Solution: Explicitly call on quiet people: "Sarah, what are your thoughts?"

**Problem: No time for all activities**
- Solution: Build 20-30% buffer time into estimates
- Solution: Be willing to cut less important activities
- Solution: Extend time if discussion is valuable, or schedule follow-up

**Problem: Ideas feel too scattered**
- Solution: Use synthesis time to group ideas by theme
- Solution: Apply frameworks (2x2 matrices, prioritization grids)
- Solution: Use dot voting to narrow focus
- Solution: Assign one person to synthesize during breaks

### 7. Workshop Templates

**Problem Statement Template:**
```
[User/Stakeholder] needs a way to [need/goal] because [insight/problem].

Current problem: [describe current state]
Ideal state: [describe desired outcome]
```

**Customer Journey Map Template:**
- Phase 1: [Phase Name]
  - Touchpoints: [list]
  - Emotions: [happy/neutral/frustrated]
  - Pain points: [list]
  - Opportunities: [list]
- Phase 2: [repeat]

**Ideation Prioritization Matrix:**
```
High Impact, Low Effort → Quick Wins (do these)
High Impact, High Effort → Major Projects (plan these)
Low Impact, Low Effort → Fill-ins (do if time)
Low Impact, High Effort → Avoid (don't do these)
```

### 8. Pro Tips

**For Better Ideation:**
- Encourage quantity over quality initially
- Welcome "bad" and unfeasible ideas - they spark better ones
- Use Crazy 8s technique for people intimidated by sketching
- Combine ideas: "What if we took idea A and merged it with idea B?"

**For Better Problem-Solving:**
- Ask "why" 5 times to get to root cause
- Separate symptoms from the actual problem
- Frame problems as opportunities: "How might we...?"

**For Better Journey Mapping:**
- Focus on one persona at a time
- Include emotional journey, not just steps
- Interview customers before or after to validate
- Map both current state and ideal future state

**For Better Facilitation:**
- Show up 10 minutes early to prep space and tech
- Put on calm background music (in-person, with permission)
- Have water and snacks available
- Stop for breaks every 60-90 minutes
- Thank participants and acknowledge their contributions
- Send recap within 24 hours while momentum is high

## Key Principles

**Workshops are about getting stuff done** - They're milestones to start things or make decisions, not just discussions.

**Quality comes from structure** - Good workshops have clear goals, activities, and outcomes planned in advance.

**Everyone participates** - Keep groups small enough (5-8 people) for active contribution from all.

**Quantity before quality** - In ideation, get all ideas out before evaluating. "Bad" ideas often spark the best solutions.

**Time is precious** - As facilitator, ensure everyone's time is spent wisely and you uncover insights needed to move forward.
