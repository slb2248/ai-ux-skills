# Design Critique Framework

A structured approach to giving and receiving design feedback.

## Before the Critique

### Presenter Preparation
1. **State the context**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Who is the target user?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Define the scope**
   - What stage is this work?
   - What feedback do you need?
   - What's out of scope?

3. **Share materials in advance**
   - Design files or prototypes
   - User research findings
   - Business requirements

### Facilitator Preparation
- Set time limits
- Define feedback format
- Prepare prompts

## Critique Structure

### 1. Presentation (5-10 min)
Presenter shares:
- Problem statement
- User needs
- Design solution
- Specific questions

### 2. Clarifying Questions (5 min)
Reviewers ask questions to understand:
- "What happens when...?"
- "How did you decide...?"
- "What alternatives did you consider?"

### 3. Feedback Round (15-20 min)
Each reviewer shares observations using the format below.

### 4. Discussion (10 min)
- Explore key themes
- Identify next steps
- Prioritize changes

## Feedback Format

### The "I Like, I Wish, What If" Method

**I Like...**
What's working well
"I like how the onboarding flow reduces friction."

**I Wish...**
Opportunities for improvement
"I wish the error states were more helpful."

**What If...**
Ideas to explore
"What if we added a progress indicator?"

### The Observation Method

**Observation → Impact → Suggestion**

"I notice the CTA is below the fold. This might reduce conversions. Consider testing it above the fold."

## Types of Feedback

### Actionable vs. Preferential

**Actionable (Give this)**
"The contrast ratio on this button is 2.8:1, which fails WCAG AA. Increase the contrast to at least 4.5:1."

**Preferential (Avoid this)**
"I don't like the blue. Try green instead."

### Specific vs. Vague

**Specific (Give this)**
"The form has 12 fields. Consider progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load."

**Vague (Avoid this)**
"This feels overwhelming."

## Feedback by Design Stage

### Early Exploration
Focus on:
- Problem framing
- Conceptual direction
- User needs alignment

Avoid:
- Visual polish details
- Pixel-level feedback
- Implementation concerns

### Mid-Fidelity
Focus on:
- Information architecture
- User flows
- Interaction patterns

Avoid:
- Final copy critique
- Color/font perfection
- Edge cases

### High-Fidelity
Focus on:
- Visual consistency
- Accessibility compliance
- Content quality
- Edge cases

## Receiving Feedback

### Do
- Listen fully before responding
- Take notes
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank reviewers
- Follow up on actions

### Don't
- Defend every decision
- Explain away feedback
- Take it personally
- Ignore patterns in feedback

## Facilitation Tips

### Time Management
- Set clear time boxes
- Use a timer
- Interrupt politely if needed

### Encourage Participation
- Go around the room
- Call on quiet people
- Limit dominant voices

### Stay On Track
- Redirect tangents
- Park off-topic items
- Summarize key points

### Document Outcomes
- Capture all feedback
- Note priorities
- Assign owners to action items

## Remote Critique Best Practices

- Use collaborative tools (Figma, Miro)
- Enable commenting
- Mute when not speaking
- Use video for engagement
- Record for absent team members
